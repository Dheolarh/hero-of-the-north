Guidelines:
- Use NPM dependencies if needed, ensure they are web compatible
- You cannot use websockets. Call devvit_search and query for "realtime" to get more information
- Obey the rules of hooks and only write valid React code

Unity WebGL Integration:
- Unity build files are in `src/client/public/Build/` (binary files, don't edit directly)
- The Unity loader is configured in `src/client/script.ts`
- Unity build files (*.unityweb, Build/, TemplateData/) are ignored by Cursor (.cursorignore)
- To update the Unity game, rebuild from Unity Editor and replace files in public/Build/
- Communication between Unity and JavaScript happens via `unityInstance.SendMessage()` from JS side
